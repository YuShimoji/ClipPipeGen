# ClipPipeGen Docs Wiki

## What This Is

This is the human-facing wiki entrance for ClipPipeGen. It points to the
current resume surface, active review artifacts, feature status, and contracts
without requiring a reader to scan every historical Markdown file.

ClipPipeGen is a production-assist pipeline for connecting source media,
rights readback, transcript/subtitles, cut candidates, diagnostic review
artifacts, NLE handoff, and later publishing surfaces. The docs are organized
around workflow decisions, not only around file names.

## Current State

Current active focus is `ED-10g`: the selected
`noto_sans_jp_clean_outline` subtitle typography / decoration base has been
applied to the `cut_002` / `cut_003` diagnostic overlay proof. The proof is
registered as `clip-ed10g-noto-overlay-proof-001` and awaits human diagnostic /
representative visual judgement.

Start here:

## Next

Use the dashboard to identify stale / unclear / over-guarded docs, then improve
the highest-friction pages one slice at a time. A good docs update should make
the first screen of a major doc answer:

- what the page is for
- what is true now
- what can happen next
- what constraints or risks limit the next decision

For new feature docs, start from [_templates/feature.md](_templates/feature.md)
instead of copying an older long-form handoff.

## Constraints / Risks

- Local `episodes/` artifacts are same-machine evidence and remain ignored by
  Git.
- Diagnostic proof success is not production render acceptance, production
  subtitle design acceptance, creative acceptance, rights approval, publishing
  acceptance, or public-use permission.
- Long historical closeouts belong in archive/history surfaces, not in the
  first page a human has to read.
- Visual structure diagrams should start as Mermaid, SVG, HTML, or CSS meaning
  slots before any Inkscape polish. If third-party visual assets are used, keep
  source, license, attribution, and adoption reason in the artifact manifest.
