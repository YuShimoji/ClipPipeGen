# ClipPipeGen Docs Wiki

## What This Is

This is the human-facing wiki entrance for ClipPipeGen. It points to the
current resume surface, active review artifacts, feature status, and contracts
without requiring a reader to scan every historical Markdown file.

ClipPipeGen is a production-assist pipeline for connecting source media,
rights readback, transcript/subtitles, cut candidates, diagnostic review
artifacts, NLE handoff, and later publishing surfaces. The docs are organized
around workflow decisions, not only around file names.

## Current State

Current active focus is `ED-10i`: the latest human review says the previous
`noto_sans_jp_clean_outline` proof is not accepted as-is, and the reviewed
ED-10i contact sheet picked the bottom-most gothic candidate as closest to the
current ideal. The local JSON resolves that candidate to
`ed10i_meiryo_bold_fill_outline_balance`, and the current proof artifact is
`clip-ed10i-meiryo-overlay-proof-001` for `cut_002` / `cut_003`.

Start here:

| Need | Entry |
|---|---|
| Current resume capsule | [RUNTIME_STATE.md](RUNTIME_STATE.md) |
| Generated docs dashboard | [dashboard/index.html](dashboard/index.html) |
| Dashboard metadata | [dashboard/project-status.json](dashboard/project-status.json) |
| Feature progress table | [features/index.md](features/index.md) |
| Reviewable artifact registry | [../artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md](../artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md) |
| Feature status authority | [FEATURE_REGISTRY.md](FEATURE_REGISTRY.md) |
| Subtitle font candidate registry | [SUBTITLE_FONT_CANDIDATE_SWEEP.md](SUBTITLE_FONT_CANDIDATE_SWEEP.md) |
| Operator review shape | [OPERATOR_REVIEW_UX.md](OPERATOR_REVIEW_UX.md) |
| Review workflow map | [EPISODE_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md](EPISODE_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md) |

## Open Surfaces

Normal order:

1. Run `.\open-dashboard.ps1`.
2. Choose the artifact or doc from the dashboard.
3. Use an artifact-specific launcher only when needed.

| Command | Opens | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `.\open-dashboard.ps1` | `docs/dashboard/index.html` | Default start for current focus, feature progress, active artifacts, and doc-health findings. |
| `.\open-artifacts.ps1` | `artifacts/ARTIFACTS.md` | You need the artifact registry entry and exact open/readback notes. |
| `.\open-current-proof.ps1` | ignored local ED-10i Meiryo overlay proof if present | You are reviewing the selected bottom-candidate overlay proof for `cut_002` / `cut_003`. Missing proof is reported clearly and is not a Git failure. |
| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File episodes\jp_pilot01_hololive_bancho_20260525\review\jp_pilot01r3_cut_review\subtitle_kirinuki_gothic_balance_comparison\open_comparison.ps1` | ignored local ED-10i gothic balance comparison if present | You need to audit why the bottom candidate resolved to Meiryo. |
| `.\open-font-candidates.ps1` | `docs/SUBTITLE_FONT_CANDIDATE_SWEEP.md` | You are deciding whether ED-10h should use local-only fonts or approved font downloads. |

Regenerate the dashboard only after tracked docs/artifact registry changes:

```powershell
uvx python -m src.cli.main build-docs-dashboard --format json
```

## Next

Use the current ED-10i Meiryo overlay proof first when the next decision is
subtitle styling. Use the comparison contact sheet only when the candidate
choice itself needs to be audited. Use the dashboard to identify stale /
unclear / over-guarded docs only when the current styling decision is not being
advanced. A good docs update
should make the first screen of a major doc answer:

- what the page is for
- what is true now
- what can happen next
- what constraints or risks limit the next decision

For new feature docs, start from [_templates/feature.md](_templates/feature.md)
instead of copying an older long-form handoff.

## Constraints / Risks

- Local `episodes/` artifacts are same-machine evidence and remain ignored by
  Git.
- Diagnostic proof success is not production render acceptance, production
  subtitle design acceptance, creative acceptance, rights approval, publishing
  acceptance, or public-use permission.
- Long historical closeouts belong in archive/history surfaces, not in the
  first page a human has to read.
- Visual structure diagrams should start as Mermaid, SVG, HTML, or CSS meaning
  slots before any Inkscape polish. If third-party visual assets are used, keep
  source, license, attribution, and adoption reason in the artifact manifest.
